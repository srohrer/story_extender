THE FORGOTTEN PATH

Sarah traced her fingers along the ancient stone wall, feeling the cool, damp surface beneath her fingertips. The forest surrounding the ruins had grown silent, as if holding its breath in anticipation. Three days of searching, and finally she'd found it – the entrance to the Temple of Whispers.

"This has to be it," she murmured, brushing away centuries of moss to reveal faint carvings beneath. The markings matched the fragments in her grandfather's journal perfectly.

From behind her came the snap of a twig. Sarah spun around, heart racing, to find Marcus leaning against a tree, arms crossed and wearing that insufferable smirk.

"Took you long enough," he said, pushing himself upright and walking toward her. "I was beginning to think the famous Dr. Sarah Chen had finally met her match."

Sarah rolled her eyes. "I don't recall inviting you on this expedition, Marcus."

"You didn't," he replied, joining her at the wall. "But when I heard rumors that James Chen's granddaughter was following his footsteps into these mountains, I couldn't resist. Besides, you might need someone to pull you out of trouble."

"The last time we worked together, you were the one who needed saving," Sarah reminded him, returning her attention to the wall. "The temple should be right behind this section, but I can't find the mechanism to open it."

Marcus studied the wall, then the surrounding area. "Your grandfather's journal mentioned something about stars aligning, didn't it? Maybe it's not just poetic language."

Sarah frowned, flipping through the weathered pages of the journal. "Here—'When the Pleiades shine through the crown of the sentinel, the path will reveal itself.'"

They both looked up at the towering oak tree that stood like a solitary guard beside the stone wall. Its upper branches spread out like a crown against the darkening sky.

"We'll have to wait until nightfall," Sarah said, checking her watch. "Another three hours."

Marcus settled on a fallen log, pulling out a thermos. "Coffee?" he offered.

Despite her annoyance at his unexpected appearance, Sarah accepted the steaming cup gratefully. The mountain air was growing colder as the sun began its descent.

"Why are you really here, Marcus?" she asked after a while. "This isn't just about curiosity."

He stared into his coffee cup for a long moment. "Your grandfather wasn't the only one searching for the Temple of Whispers. My father was his partner before their... disagreement."

"I didn't know that," Sarah said softly.

"Most people don't. Dad never published his findings after they parted ways. But he never stopped searching either." Marcus pulled a folded paper from his jacket pocket. "He died last month. Cancer. He gave me this before he went."

Sarah carefully unfolded the paper—a map, similar to her grandfather's but with additional notations.

"I'm sorry about your father," she said. "My grandfather never talked about his early expeditions."

As darkness fell, they waited in silence, watching as stars began to appear overhead. The forest seemed to come alive with night sounds—the hooting of an owl, the rustle of small creatures in the underbrush.

When the Pleiades finally rose into view, Sarah and Marcus positioned themselves behind the ancient oak. From that specific angle, the star cluster shone directly through a gap in the branches.

"Look," Marcus whispered, pointing at the wall.

Where the starlight touched the stone, the faint carvings began to glow with a soft blue light, revealing an intricate pattern that had been invisible before.

Sarah pressed her hand against the center of the pattern, and with a low rumble, the wall began to slide open, revealing a dark passage beyond.

"Ready?" she asked, switching on her flashlight.

Marcus nodded, his earlier smugness replaced by genuine wonder. "Lead the way, Dr. Chen."

Together, they stepped through the entrance, unaware of the shadowy figure watching from the trees behind them.
